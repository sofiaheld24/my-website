       I’m a psychologist with a background in behavioral science and business administration, and with a passion for technology and human wellbeing. I believe in using evidence-based insights to help people and organizations not just function — but truly thrive.

My work explores how we can design better systems, build healthier habits, and enhance performance through behavior change. From individual wellbeing to organizational development, I’m driven by the idea that science can help us all outperform our limits — with clarity, compassion, and purpose.

Whether you're here out of curiosity, collaboration, or shared interests, I’m glad you stopped by. Feel free to explore and reach out!
