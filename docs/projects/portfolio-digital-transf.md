# Behaviour Change in Digital Transformation

## Project Overview

In the face of rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly investing in *digital transformation* to stay competitive and efficient. However, one of the most persistent barriers to successful implementation is *employee resistance to change*.

This project explores digital transformation through the lens of *change management, with a focus on identifying and addressing the **psychological, social, and structural factors* that drive resistance among employees.

## Approach

Using established behavioural science frameworks—particularly the *Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW)* and *COM-B model*—the project:

- Conducts a *behavioural diagnosis* to understand the root causes of resistance  
- Identifies key *barriers and enablers* to behavioural change  
- Applies the *APEASE criteria* to evaluate intervention options  
- Proposes targeted strategies to foster engagement and reduce resistance  

## Key Outcomes

- A structured framework to *bridge the gap between people and technology*  
- Practical tools to support *communication, training, and cultural adaptation*  
- Recommendations for designing *interventions that are acceptable, feasible, and effective*  
- Integration of behavioural science with *real-world organizational change*  

## Why It Matters

Behavioural change is not just a byproduct of digital transformation—it’s a *critical success factor*. Without employee adoption of new systems and processes, digital initiatives fail to deliver their full value.

This project offers organizations a roadmap to:  
- *Reduce digital resistance*  
- *Enable sustainable change*  
- *Align people, processes, and platforms*
