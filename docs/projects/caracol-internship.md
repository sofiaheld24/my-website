# Increasing Employee Engagement with E-learning Plattforms (Redcare Pharmacy Internship)

## Overview
This qualitative study explored how distributed teams coordinate and maintain engagement when working remotely. Conducted for a consulting engagement with Company X in Spring 2024.

## Background & Objectives
- **Context**: Rising trend of hybrid work prompted Company X to understand challenges in remote collaboration.
- **Objective**: Identify communication pain points and propose behavioural interventions to improve engagement and productivity.

## Methods
- **Design**: Semi-structured interviews with 20 team members across departments.
- **Data Collection**: Interviews conducted via video call, recorded with consent, transcribed and anonymized.
- **Analysis**: Thematic analysis using NVivo; coding framework developed iteratively.
- **Ethics**: Participants provided informed consent; transcripts stored securely; identifiable data removed.

## Key Findings
1. **Over-communication Fatigue**: Many participants felt overwhelmed by constant messaging.
2. **Lack of Rituals**: Absence of informal “watercooler” interactions decreased sense of team cohesion.
3. **Boundary Blur**: Difficulty separating work/home due to flexible schedules, affecting attention.

## Recommendations & Impact
- **Structured Communication Windows**: Suggest “focus hours” with minimal notifications; pilot with Team A resulted in a 15% self-reported increase in concentration.  
- **Virtual Social Rituals**: Weekly “coffee chat” sessions; feedback indicated improved team cohesion.  
- **Boundary Guidelines**: Developed guidelines for after-hours messaging; adopted by leadership.
