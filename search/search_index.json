We used a moderation model, where the type of message (positive, negative, or control) was the independent variable, self-efficacy and attitudes towards physical activity were moderators, and the difference in physical activity over a period of a month was the dependent variable. In a flow chart, we can visualize this as</p> <p><pre><code>graph LR\n  D{Self-Efficay} --&gt;|\u03b2| B;\n  A --&gt; X((( )));\n  D --&gt; X;\n  X --&gt; |\u03b4| B\n  A[Message Framing] --&gt; |\u03b1| B[Change in Physical Activity];\n  A --&gt; Y((( )));\n  E --&gt; Y;\n  Y --&gt; |\u03b5| B;\n  E{Attitudes} --&gt; |\u03b3| B;</code></pre> In particular, naming message framing as \\(X\\), the the moderators \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) for self-efficacy and attitudes respectively, and \\(Y\\) for the change in physical activity, the model takes the form </p> \\[Y = c+ \\alpha X + \\beta M_1 + \\gamma M_2 + \\delta X \\cdot M_1 + \\varepsilon X \\cdot M_2\\] <p>for which I used a simple regression to find the optimum coefficients \\(c, \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma,\\delta, \\varepsilon\\).
